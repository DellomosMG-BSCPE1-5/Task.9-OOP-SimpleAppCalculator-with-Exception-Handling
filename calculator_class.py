#Redo calculator program applying the OOP concept.

#pseudocode for the class file
#create a file for the calculator class that contains necessary methods

#for the class file, create a class named Calculator
class Calculator:

    #under the Calculator class, create a method for the menu
    def menu(self):
        #under the menu method, ask the user what operation he/she wants to use

        #the 1st number is inputs[0] and the 2nd number is inputs[1]
        sum = inputs[0] + inputs[1]

#create method for division operation
#under the division method, call the get_numbers method to get the inputs from user that are needed to perform the operation
#perform the division operation on two numbers.
#the 1st number is inputs[0] and the 2nd number is inputs[1]
