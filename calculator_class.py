#for the class file, create a class named Calculator
#under the Calculator class, create a method for the menu

#create method for subtraction operation
#under the subtraction method, perform the subtraction operation on two numbers
#return the difference of the two numbers
#create method for multiplication operation
#under the multiplication method, perform the multiplication operation on two numbers
#return the product of the two numbers
#create method for division operation
#under the division method, perform the division operation on two numbers
#insert exception handling (ZeroDivisionError) incase the zero number is equal to zero
#call the user input method to ask for user's input again. This time, the second number should not be equal to zero again.
#return the product of the two numbers if the first and second numbers are valid and successfully obtained their quotient
